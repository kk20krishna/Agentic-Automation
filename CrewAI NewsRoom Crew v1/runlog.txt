**Trump and Zelensky: Ukraine Peace Talks Face Hurdles as Key Leaders Absent**

The latest round of Ukraine peace talks in Turkey saw a notable absence of both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, casting doubt on the prospects of a breakthrough. The U.S. has expressed skepticism about the likelihood of progress, emphasizing the challenges of reaching a resolution without the direct involvement of the two leaders. The talks, aimed at de-escalating the ongoing conflict, have so far failed to yield significant results, with both sides remaining entrenched in their positions. According to *The Independent*, the absence of Putin and Zelensky underscores the deep divisions hindering peace efforts ([source](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/ukraine-russia-war-latest-us-says-peace-breakthrough-unlikely-as-putin-and-zelensky-skip-turkey-talks/ar-AA1Ew1Xq)).

Former U.S. President Donald Trump has recently weighed in on the conflict, reiterating his claim that he could swiftly end the war if re-elected. Trump’s comments have drawn mixed reactions, with critics questioning his ability to deliver on such promises. Meanwhile, Zelensky has continued to appeal for Western support, stressing the urgent need for military aid to counter Russian advances. The ongoing stalemate highlights the complexities of the conflict and the limited influence of external actors in brokering peace.

Zelensky’s decision to skip the Turkey talks reflects his administration’s stance that negotiations without concrete concessions from Russia are futile. The Ukrainian leader has repeatedly called for the restoration of his country’s territorial integrity as a precondition for peace. On the other hand, Trump’s rhetoric has raised concerns among allies about the potential for unilateral U.S. actions that could undermine collective efforts. The situation remains fluid, with diplomatic efforts struggling to gain traction amid escalating hostilities.

As the war drags on, the absence of key leaders from critical negotiations signals a deepening impasse. The U.S. and its allies continue to support Ukraine, but the path to peace remains uncertain. Trump’s assertions and Zelensky’s unwavering demands further complicate the geopolitical landscape. With no immediate resolution in sight, the conflict’s humanitarian and economic toll continues to grow, leaving millions in limbo. For now, the world watches as diplomatic efforts falter and the war shows no signs of abating ([source](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/ukraine-russia-war-latest-us-says-peace-breakthrough-unlikely-as-putin-and-zelensky-skip-turkey-talks/ar-AA1Ew1Xq)).

**India’s Strategic Response to the Ukraine Conflict Amidst Global Diplomatic Stalemate**

The absence of Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodadymyr Zelensky from the latest peace talks in Turkey underscores the deepening complexities of the Ukraine conflict, with global powers struggling to broker a resolution. For India, this diplomatic impasse presents both challenges and opportunities. As a nation that has maintained a balanced stance, advocating for dialogue while refraining from outright condemnation of Russia, India must continue to leverage its strategic autonomy to engage with all stakeholders. The lack of progress in peace talks reinforces the need for India to push for a multipolar world order where emerging economies like India can play a mediating role in global conflicts.

The war’s prolonged duration has already disrupted global supply chains, impacting India’s energy security and economic stability
